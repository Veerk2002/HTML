            First of all, education gives the ability to read and write to anyone. 
            A good education is extremely essential for everyone to grow and succeed in life. 
            Education increases self-confidence and assists in developing the personality of a person. 
            Education plays a big role in our life. Education is split into 3 parts such as primary education,
            secondary education, and higher secondary education. All these 3 divisions of education have their 
            value and advantages. Primary education is the base of education for a person, secondary education
            paves the direction for further education and higher secondary education makes the future and the ultimate way of life.

            engineers, IAS or PCS officers, or any other high-level professions.
            All such goals of kids or parents can be achieved by education only.
